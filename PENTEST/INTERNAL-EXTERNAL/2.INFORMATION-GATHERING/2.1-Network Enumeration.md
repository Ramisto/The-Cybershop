Enumeration is key <3

## Methods

#### Practical scans in CTF

The oaf scan : 
```shell-session
sudo nmap -A -p- <ip>
```

####   Practical scans in real life

Discover hosts quickly within an internal network (if the client machines ignore ICMP packets, then this command will not work):

```shell-session
sudo nmap 192.168.1.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```

Same with a list of IP addresses provided by the client (hosts.lst):
```shell-session
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```


TCP-SYN scan (fairly discreet and little risk of crashing the target):
```shell-session
sudo nmap -sS <ip>
```
