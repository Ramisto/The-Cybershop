| Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pentest  | Type of service including a fairly restricted test scope defined by the client, the time frame is generally quite short (one week of service), and the auditors are authorized to be somewhat discreet in their actions.                                                                                                                              |
| Red-Team | Type of service including a much broader scope than the pentest, and the time frame of the service can extend over several months. Generally, the client wishes to take this type of service to test its internal security policy, and its supervision equipment, it is therefore strongly recommended to use discreet methods to go under the radar. |

| Type     | Information provided                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blackbox | Only essential information, such as IP addresses and domain names.                                                                                                                          |
| Greybox  | Additional information is provided, such as specific hostnames, subnets, machines that the customer would like to target as a priority.                                                     |
| Whitebox | A maximum of information is provided by the client, such as an infrastructure diagram, administrator identifiers, detailed configurations, or even the source code of certain applications. |
