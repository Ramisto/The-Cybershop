# Information Gathering

## Description

If you want to rob a bank, are you going to rush in head first without any information and without preparation? What will be your chances of succeeding in your heist?

It is the same for the information gathering, this step is the most important in the context of a penetration test, it will determine your ability to find security weaknesses in the next phases of the test.

To put it simply, the more relevant information you find during this phase, the greater your chances of finding security weaknesses, so do not hesitate to take your time to accomplish this task.

## Methods

### Step.1 Find different subdomains & IP

```
subfinder -d www.example.com -all -active only -v -o output.txt # web-based DNS search
host -t ns www.example.com # DNS zone transfers
dig www.example.com # IP
```
With subfinder, if you want to improve the results, you can add other sources with your API keys in conf file:

### Step.2 Enumerate applications on Web server

```
nmap –Pn –sT –sV –p0-65535 <IP> # non-standard ports 
ffuf -w /path/to/dico -u https://www.example.com/FFUF # directory listings
```

### Step.3 Identify web crawlers files

Use curl for rewiew metafiles :

```
curl https://www.example.com/robots.txt
curl https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml
curl https://www.example.com/.well-known/security.txt
curl https://www.example.com/humans.txt
```

### Step.4 Version control history

Sometimes web applications expose the .git directory by default, this is used to store version control system data (usually git):

```
curl https://www.example.com/.git
```

### Step.5 Determine frameworks version and type of web server

Use curl :

```
curl -I https://www.example.com
```

Send malformed request with Burp Suite repeater for review error messages :

```
GET / SANTA CLAUS/1.1
```

And use [Wappalyzer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wappalyzer-technology-pro/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg?hl=fr) browser extension for identify frameworks version.

### Step.6 Analyze the source code

Please check whether sensitive information is exposed in the following:

```
- Comments <!-- ... -->
- META tags <META...>
- JavaScript code <script>...</script>
```
