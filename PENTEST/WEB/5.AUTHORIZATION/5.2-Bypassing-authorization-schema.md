# Bypassing Authorization Schema


## Description

### Authentication

Process that verifies that a user is who they say they are.

- something you know (password, secret question)
- something you own (2FA, yubikey)
- something you are (biometrics)

### Autorization

Policy which consists of determining the access level of a user or service (also called privilege level).

### Access Control 

Process that enforces the authorization policy.

### Vertical privilege escalation

The fact that a user can access features or data that they are not authorized to access (example: a user who accesses a feature reserved for administrators).
### Horizontal privilege escalation

The fact that user A can access functionalities or data reserved for user B (example: within a banking application, Alice accesses Bob's data even though she does not have authorization to do so ).

## Methods

### Unprotected administrative functionality

Visit the robots.txt file or use gobuster/ffuf with a wordlist to discover hidden admin features: 

```http
https://insecure-website.com/admin
```

### Obfuscated administrative functionality
