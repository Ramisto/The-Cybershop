# Clickjacking

## Description

Clickjacking is a technique that allows legitimate elements to be inserted into a malicious web application to deceive the end user and encourage them to enter confidential data.

## Methods

Here is an example of an attack illustrated by [Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/clickjacking/):

```
"
1.The attacker creates an attractive page which promises to give the user a free trip to Tahiti.
2.In the background the attacker checks if the user is logged into his banking site and if so, loads the screen that enables transfer of funds, using query parameters to insert the attacker’s bank details into the form.
3.The bank transfer page is displayed in an invisible iframe above the free gift page, with the “Confirm Transfer” button exactly aligned over the “Receive Gift” button visible to the user.
4.The user visits the page and clicks the “Book My Free Trip” button.
5.In reality the user is clicking on the invisible iframe, and has clicked the “Confirm Transfer” button. Funds are transferred to the attacker.
6.The user is redirected to a page with information about the free gift (not knowing what happened in the background).

This example illustrates that, in a clickjacking attack, the malicious action (on the bank website, in this case) cannot be traced back to the attacker because the user performed it while being legitimately signed into their own account."
```

Here is an example of HTML code which allows you to check if the web application is vulnerable, if this is indeed the case, then the iframe will be displayed:

```
<html>
<head>
<title>Clickjack test page</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Website is vulnerable to clickjacking!</p>
<iframe src="http://www.example.com/sensitive-page" width="500" height="500"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```
